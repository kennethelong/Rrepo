# Iris  data

```{r}
head(iris)
```
The `iris` data is a classical dataset that comes with R. Read the documentation of the dataset. The dataset contains features of 50 sample of each of three varieties of the iris flower. 

In this case we know the variety (that is the cluster), and the task is to investigate how well clustering performs in identifying these varieties.

Make pairwise plots of all variables. Make sure that the varieties are shown in different colours. Based on such plots, how well do you anticipate the clustering algorithm to work?

```{r}
library(GGally)

GGally::ggpairs(iris, aes(color = Species, alpha = 0.5)) + 
  theme_minimal()

## your code
```


Define dataset with the numerical values only:
```{r}
ir <- iris[,1:4]

 head(ir)
```

Run a clustering algorithm on this dataset. Should data be scaled before doing the clustering?

```{r, eval=F}
ir2 <- scale(ir)
dvec <- dist(ir2, method = "euclidian")
hc <- hclust(dvec)
plot(hc)
rect.hclust(hc, k = 3, border = 2:5)
```


Extract 10 clusters and make a cross tabulation of the clusters and the species in the `iris` dataset. Here, `table()` is a good friend.

```{r, eval=F}
clusters <- c(10)
cl <- cutree(hc, k=clusters)
table(cl, iris$Species)
```



Experiment with extracting 2, 3 and 4 clusters from data and cross tabulate these the species. Based on this, how well do will you say that clustering works for these data? Are you surprised?


Create scatterplots where you label points according to  the case `k=3`:
